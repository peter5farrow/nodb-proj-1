# Disc Golf Bag Builder

The Disc Golf Bag Builder is an easy way to keep track of all of the discs in your disc golf bag, so you can make sure to have all of your shots covered! It makes it easy to:

-Add new discs

> Add the name, speed, and stability of each disc.

-Edit existing discs

> If you need to change a disc in your bag, just click the Edit button to update it.

-Remove discs

> Click the x button if it's time to retire a disc from the bag.

-Visualize your bag

> Discs will appear in your bag with a different color for each speed category (putters, midranges, fairways, and distance drivers).
